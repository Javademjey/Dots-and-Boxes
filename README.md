# Dots-and-Boxes
This is a Dot and Box game.

Game description:
The goal in this game is to occupy a square, and this happens if four lines are placed in a square, and someone gets the points of the square that has inserted the last line.
The dot and box game is a two-player game. I designed the game so that your opponent is the system.
When you start the game, the first move is yours, then the game screen is shown, and when you pass the game screen, your opponent's system move is shown.
At the beginning of the game, you will be asked how many squares the board has and you enter the game.
It will then ask you to select a number from 1 to n (n = the number of squares you have entered) this number represents the number of the square you have selected and again it will ask you to
select a number from 1 to 4 and this indicates the line number that you insert in the desired square.
This process continues until all the squares are occupied, and when all the squares are occupied, the game ends and the one who occupies the most squares wins the game.
